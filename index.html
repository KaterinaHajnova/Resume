        My professional path has been going a long time through
        <strong>the project & cost management</strong> in consulting companies
        into creating, planning & managing media content & Ads. The creative ME
        has a detailed sense for linguistics, visual design & photo /
        videography, when the analytical and practical ME is transforming it
        into schedules, numbers or meetings and workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past 3 years, I've been living in my backpack, freelancing from
        the beaches of Australia or hidden pubs in the South American Andes. I
        jumped out of waterfalls in Ecuadorian Amazon, drank kava with Fijians &
        brewed my own coffee in Medellin. Now, for nearly a year I am working as
        a CRM & project manager in, especially now, booming gaming industry.
        I've leant how to code, lead own projects and how to efficiently
        communicate marketing messages to specific groups of
        audiences. Nevertheless, my naturally adventure-obsessed soul hasn't
        found a complete fulfilment so I am now searching, back in the mountains
        and the company where I was the happiest.
